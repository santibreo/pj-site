HOW TO
What are you able to do now:
    + Use:
        ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
            message("A standard message")
        ```
        ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
            warning("A warning message")
        ```
        ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
            stop("A error message")
        ```
    To add really cool formatted messages to your document.
    You can still use standard markdown syntax inside that messages. AWESOME!
    
    + Use:
        ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", class = "center-pic"}
            include_graphics("/path/to/your/image.png")
        ```
    To show centered and not too wide pictures.

FEATURES
How your document will be rendered:
    + Justified: Because we hate chaotic line lengths.
    + Dark Code theme: Because it is how we are used to write it.
    + Floating TOC: Because it is what makes it useful.

FOR REALS
If you have previous knowledge:
    + You can add style features editing the CSS code between <style> tags.
    Don't use a standalone file for a template, it will be copied everywhere.
    + If you use the Vim shortcuts you have B(egin) at first edit line.

TODOS
Every help would be welcomed:
    + A header and footer will probably make html looking better.

I have just make some algebra to understand how the amortization works and 
which is the best way to pay a Loan. A few definitions are necessary to 
understand the following calculus.

* N = Notional: **Initial** amount borrowed by the lender.
* O$_k$ = \*Outstanding: Remaining or unpaid loan amount.
* A$_k$ = \*Amortization: Portion of the nominal amount that is paid in each 
  payment.
* r$_k$ = \*Interest Rate: Annualized interest rate applied to the Loan. It
  could be fixed or variable.
* $\Delta$t$_k$ = \*Year fraction: Fraction of the year since last payment.
* n = Total number of payments: The number of payments in which the loan is 
  expected to be settled.
* I$_k$ = \*Interest Payment. Interest to be paid on each payment.
  $$
  I_k = O_{k-1} \cdot r_k \cdot \Delta t_k 
  $$


There are 3 ways to amortize a loan:

1. Bullet: During the life of the loan only interest is paid and at the end the
   nominal is settled.
2. Constant: The same nominal amount is amortized in each payment.
3. French: A minimally sophisticated formula is applied in which several of the 
   defined variables intervene to calculate the fee to be paid, which includes 
   interest:
   $$
   P_k = A_k + I_k = O_{k-1} \cdot \frac{r_k \cdot \Delta t_k}{1-(1 + r_k \cdot \Delta t_k)^{n-k+1}}
   $$

In this post I have focus on the methods that have payments during the 
loan's life. So I won't concern about bullet method, which amortization is 
pretty straightforward.

# Doing the math

Due to the amortizations selected, each amortization depends on the remaining 
amount after each payment, which we can write as:
$$
A_k = \alpha_k \cdot O_{k-1}\\
with\ O_0 = N
$$

For the successive payments:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
A_1 &=& N \cdot \alpha_1\\
A_2 &=& O_1 \cdot \alpha_2 = N(1 - \alpha_1) \cdot \alpha_2 \\
A_3 &=& O_2 \cdot \alpha_3 = N(1 - \alpha_1)(1 - \alpha_2) \cdot \alpha_3 \\
\ldots
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Which reveals a clear pattern, the Outstanding can be written as:
$$
O_k = N \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{k}(1 - \alpha_i)
$$

So now we can just focus on $\alpha$, that depends on the amortization type.

## Warmup (CONSTANT)

The constant amortization is not a big deal, so here I am showing how to work 
with it as a way to get used to the method, but the **french** amortization
is the one that motivate this post. First of all the $\alpha$, which comes
from the amortization definition:
$$
A_k = O_{k-1} \cdot \frac{1}{n-k+1} \rightarrow \alpha_k = \frac{1}{k-n-1}
$$

So, as it has been shown:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
O_k &=& N \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{k} \left(1 - \frac{1}{n-i+1}\right)\\
O_k &=& N \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{n-i}{n-i+1}\\
\end{eqnarray}
$$
Here the telescopic property for the product: $\prod_{i=1}^{k} \frac{a_i}{a_{i-1}} = \frac{a_k}{a_0}$
is used to simplify the expression with $a_i = n - i$:
$$
O_k = N \cdot \left(1 - \frac{k}{n}\right)
$$
Now it becomes obvious that at $k=n$ the Outstanding is 0, as it should. We can
evaluate the amortization making finite differences:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
A_k &=& O_{k-1} - O_{k} = N \cdot \left(1 - \frac{k-1}{n} - 1 + \frac{k}{n}\right)\\
A_k &=& \frac{N}{n}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

So the Amortization does not depend on $k$ (that's probably why it is called 
constant), if there are not prepayments, the amortized amount is always the 
same. Finally we should evaluate how this combines with the interest payment and
the total payment. For simplicity I am going to use 
$\beta_k = r_k \cdot \Delta t_k$.
$$
I_k = O_{k-1} \cdot \beta_k = N \cdot \beta_k \cdot \frac{n-k+1}{n}\\
P_k = \frac{N}{n} \cdot \left(1 + \beta_k \cdot (n-k+1) \right)
$$
In view of the formula it is clear that the instalment to be paid declines 
linearly with the number of payments due only to the payment of interest.
If we suppose a fixed annual Interest Rate ($r$) of 3%, a monthly payment
frequency (it is $\beta = 0.0025$) and 20 years as time to maturity of the 
loan ($n=240$); we can evaluate what percentage of each installment will 
represent the interest:
$$
IR_k = \frac{I_k}{P_k} = \frac{\beta \cdot (n-k+1)}{1 + \beta \cdot (n-k+1)}
$$
But to make the reasoning cleaner, we will calculate the percentage of the 
amount amortized, in this way the sum of these percentages will give the 
percentage of interest paid on the nominal, since the sum of the amounts 
amortized is the nominal:
$$
TIR = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{I_i}{N} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i \cdot (n-i+1)
$$
Assuming that $\beta$ is constant (as in our example):
$$
TIR = \frac{\beta \cdot (n+1)}{2}
$$


Which, with the figures given above, totals **30.125%**. So you maybe want to 
think twice before taking a loan with this amortization type.


## FRENCH

This is the amortization type I get most insterested in, because it is the most
common in mortgage loans accessed by individuals. As far as I know this method 
was developed to keep the payment constant (almost), which is what people is 
looking for when they are asking for money.

To follow the previous path first we have to remove the interests from the 
payment formula, using the previously given $\beta_k$ definition:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
P_k &=& A_k + I_k = O_{k-1} \cdot \frac{\beta_k}{1-(1 + \beta_k)^{k-n-1}}\\
A_k &=& O_{k-1} \cdot \left(\frac{\beta_k \cdot (1 + \beta_k)^{n-k+1}}{(1 + \beta_k)^{n-k+1} - 1} - \beta_k\right) = O_{k-1} \cdot \left(\frac{\beta_k}{(1 + \beta_k)^{n-k+1} - 1}\right) \\
\alpha_k &=& \frac{\beta_k}{(1 + \beta_k)^{n-k+1} - 1}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
Now I can apply the cumulative product formula that has been developed previously:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
O_k &=& N \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \left(1 - \frac{\beta_i}{(1 + \beta_i)^{n-i+1} - 1}\right) \\
&=& N \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{(1 + \beta_i)\left((1 + \beta_i)^{n-i} - 1\right)}{(1 + \beta_i)^{n-i+1} - 1}\right) \\
&=& N \cdot \left[ \prod_{i=1}^k (1+\beta_i) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{(1 + \beta_i)^{n-i} - 1}{(1 + \beta_i)^{n-i+1} - 1} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
$$

This expression doesn't allow further simplification because $\beta_k$ is different for each payment, but if we use a constant $\beta$, which could be think about as an approximation that is true when the interest is fixed (as in our example). Then we have:
$$
O_k = N \cdot (1+\beta)^k \cdot \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{(1+\beta)^{n-i} - 1}{(1+\beta)^{n-i+1} - 1}
$$

And again, using the telescopic property with $a_i = (1+\beta)^{n-i} - 1$ the we have:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
O_k &=& N \cdot (1+\beta)^k \cdot \frac{(1+\beta)^{n-k} - 1}{(1+\beta)^n - 1}\\
&=&  N \cdot \frac{(1+\beta)^{n} - (1+\beta)^k}{(1+\beta)^n - 1}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
As a check we can see that for $k=n$ this amount (the outstanding) is zero, as it must be. And the amortization can be evaluated using the difference between 2 outstanding amounts:
$$
A_k = O_{k-1} - O_k = N \cdot \frac{(1+\beta)^{k-1} \cdot \beta}{(1+\beta)^n - 1}
$$
As the time the amortization depends on the payment ($k$) we need to compute the percentage of the notional finally paid as interest by hand doing (remember $I_k = \beta_k \cdot O_k$):
$$
TIR = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{I_k}{N} = \beta \cdot \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(1+\beta)^n - (1+\beta)^k}{(1 + \beta)^n - 1}
$$
Which, for the numbers given in our example, is: **32,853%**. Almost 300 bps higher than the constant method.
