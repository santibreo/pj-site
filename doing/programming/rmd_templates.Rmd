HOW TO
What are you able to do now:
    + Use:
        ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
            message("A standard message")
        ```
        ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
            warning("A warning message")
        ```
        ```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
            stop("A error message")
        ```
    To add really cool formatted messages to your document.
    You can still use standard markdown syntax inside that messages. AWESOME!
    
    + Use:
        ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", class = "center-pic"}
            include_graphics("/path/to/your/image.png")
        ```
    To show centered and not too wide pictures.

FEATURES
How your document will be rendered:
    + Justified: Because we hate chaotic line lengths.
    + Dark Code theme: Because it is how we are used to write it.
    + Floating TOC: Because it is what makes it useful.

FOR REALS
If you have previous knowledge:
    + You can add style features editing the CSS code between <style> tags.
    Don't use a standalone file for a template, it will be copied everywhere.
    + If you use the Vim shortcuts you have B(egin) mark at first editable line.

TODOS
Every help would be welcomed:
    + A header and footer will probably make html looking better.


ENJOY IT!

installed!')

## Basics

These are the steps that are needed independently from the output type. I expect
to cover customization steps soon. 

### Create an R package:

This may sound like a simple task but it's easier if someone explains. Open your
Rstudio and make a new project (`File > New Project`):

* Select from new folder
* Give it a cool name with just letters and numbers (mine: irrbbTemplates)


### Choose template name

Into the package folder create the structure 
`inst > rmarkdown > templates > template_name`. You can create it using the
`usethis` package and `usethis::use_rmarkdown_template(template_name)` function
or by hand. Make sure that you are using some awesome name for your template and
not `template_name`. You can create as many templates as you want, each one into
its own folder (`template_name`)

### Bring your template to life

Into your `template_name` folder create a `.yaml` file with 3 lines:

* `name: template_name`. Better if you don't change this.
* `description: template description`. Feel free to write everything that can
help your template users understand what this template is for.
* `create_dir: FALSE`. Boolean, if template use requires a folder for itself say
`TRUE`.

### Set the default document

Into your `template_name` folder create a `skeleton` folder with the
`skeleton.Rmd` file inside that should be openned each time someone is using
your template. If you need any additional files (images, css, ...) make sure
that you put them inside this folder.

### Final folders structure

```
package_name
|___inst
    |___templates
        |___template_name1
        |   |___template.yaml
        |   |___skeleton
        |       |___skeleton.Rmd
        |       |___mycss.css
        |       |___mylogo.png
        |       |___whoknowswhat.wkw
        |       |___...
        |___template_name2
        |   |___template.yaml
        |   |___skeleton
        |       |___skeleton.Rmd
        |       |___mycss.css
        |       |___mylogo.png
        |       |___whoknowswhat.wkw
        |       |___...
        |___and so on ...
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, error=TRUE}
message(
"If you have multiple files into your `skeleton` folder, everytime someone
use the template all that files are going to travel with the template file, and
R is going to create a separate folder to host them (the document file + the
additional files).

This is going to make your template users have that files copied everywhere,
and errors could rise if they use weird folder names (ñ, <space>, etc.) and R
can't create the folder (and that names are pretty common around us). So I 
highly recommend to avoid the use of separate files, and try to get as far as
you can using only the `skeleton.Rmd`. But this is just what I found better for
myself.")
```

### Share the package

Before sharing your package you will probably want to compress it into a
`.tar.gz` or `.zip` file, which is the usual way, but it is not necessary. To
make your package available for everyone you just need to give them the
`package_name` folder (with everything that is inside) and once this package is
in some local location, run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("/path/to/your/package", type = "source", repos = NULL)
```

Ensure that you have change `/path/to/your/package` with the real path to your
package.

And that's it, now if you do: `File > New > Rmarkdown > From Template` your
should see any template that was contained into the package.


You should have an easy-to-share template that your colleagues must be lovin.
Enjoy!
