# Survival Models

Cox model is one of the most common model used for survival analysis. It's
commonly used because it is a **semi-parametric** model, so you can avoid the
risk of being using a wrong function. But this strength is also a weakness
because it doesn't allow you to measure absolute probabilities, just relative.

Once that is said, there's a lot of models to analyze survival data, and
following concepts are common to all of them.

The probability of one event to occur before $t$ is **the cumulative density
function (c.d.f.)**:
$$
F(t) = prob(T \leq t) = \int_0^tf(s)ds\\
where\ T\ is\ the\ \pmb{event\ time}\\
f(t)\ is\ the\ event\ \pmb{probability\ density\ function\ (p.d.f.)}
$$

Consequently, **the survival probability** is:
$$
S(t) = 1 - F(t) = Prob(T \gt t) = \int_t^\infty f(s)ds
$$

We now define the **hazard rate** as the probability that the duration will end
$dt$ time after $t$, given that it has lasted until time $t$. In other words,
the hazard rate is the probability that one individual will experience the
event at time $t$ while that individual is at risk for experiencing the event. 
$$
\begin{align}
\lambda (t) &= \lim_{dt \rightarrow 0} \frac{Prob(t \leq T \leq t + dt\ |\ T \gt t)}{dt}\\
&= \lim_{dt \rightarrow 0} \frac{F(t+dt) - F(t)}{S(t) dt}\\
&= \lim_{dt \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(t) dt}{S(t) dt}\\
&= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\\
\end{align}
$$

Now using that $\tfrac{dS(t)}{dt} = -f(t)$ we can say:
$$
\lambda (t) = -\frac{d}{dt}\log(S(t)) \iff S(t) = \exp \left( -\int_0^t \lambda(x)dx \right)
$$ 

And finally we called **the cumulative hazard rate function**:
$$
\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t\lambda(x)dx = -\log(S(t))
$$

All these concepts can be evaluated directly from the data, doing what is
called the **non parametric model**, which is useful to describe our data.

## Likelihood function

First of all we can define the **expected life** as:
$$
\begin{align}
\mu &= \int_0^\infty t \cdot f(t) dt\\
&= -\Big[ t \cdot S(t) \Big]_0^\infty + \int_0^\infty S(t) dt\\
&= \int_0^\infty S(t) dt
\end{align}
$$

But doing this, we have suppossed that we have $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}
S(t) = 0$ and that is not correct. In many cases we will found that the envents
that we are studying should not happen for the whole set that we are
considering. We can evaluate the hazard ratios, as they are well defined but
our probability density function won't converge, so it fails to integrate to
one. Therefore the expected life won't be properly defined too and so on. This
is a limitation of no great consequence because we can always evaluate this
quantities for a portion of the population in which we know the event has
happened. To solve the problem we can just define a conditional version of our
parameters:
$$
\begin{align}
f^*(t) &= \frac{f(t)}{1-S(\infty)}\\
S^*(t) &= \frac{S(t) - S(\infty)}{1-S(\infty)}\\
\lambda^*(t) &= \frac{f^*(t)}{S^*(t)} = \frac{f(t)}{S(t) - S(\infty)}
\end{align}
$$

Reader must notice that $\lambda^*(t) \geq \lambda(t)$ so what approach are we
using must be specified.

## The likelihood function

The contribution to the likelihood function of one element that has died at
$t_n$ is the density function in that moment, what we can write as:
$$
L_n = f(t_n) = S(t_n) \cdot \lambda(t_n)
$$

The contribution of one element that has kept alive after $t_i$ (non
informative censoring) is just:
$$
L_n = S(t_n)
$$

One indicator will become very handy now, **fail / censored /dead status
indicator** of each subject that can be define as:
$$
\begin{align}
\delta_n &= 
\begin{cases}
0\ if\ n\ subject\ is\ alive\\
1\ if\ n\ subject\ is\ dead / censored
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

Using it we can define our **likelihood function** (and its logarithm) as
follows:
$$
\begin{align}
L &= \prod_{n=1}^{N} L_n = S(t_n) \cdot \lambda(t_n)^{\delta_n}\\
\ell &= \log(L) = \sum_{n=1}^N \log(L_n) = \sum_{n=1}^N \ell_n\\
&= \sum_{n=1}^N \Big[ \delta_n \cdot \log(\lambda(t_n))\ +\ \log(S(t_n)) \Big] \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^N \Big[ \delta_n \cdot \log(\lambda(t_n))\ - \Lambda(t_n) \Big]
\end{align}
$$

To find the value of $\lambda$ that maximizes this function we just need to
check first and second derivatives:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \lambda} &= \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\delta_n}{\lambda(t_n)} - \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\partial \Lambda(t_n)}{\partial \lambda(t_n)}\\
&= \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\delta_n}{\lambda(t_n)} - \sum_{n=1}^{N}t_n\\
\frac{\partial^2 \ell}{\partial \lambda^2} &= - \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\delta_n}{\lambda(t_n)^2}
\end{align}
$$

# Notation

* $\{i,\ j,\ k\}$ indexes stand to differenciate risk factors, $J$ is the total
  number of risk factors
* $\{m,\ p,\ q\}$ indexes stand to differenciate event times, $M$ is the total
  number of event times.
* $R(t_m)$ if the set of individuals at risk at time $t_m$:
  - $n_m$ is the number of subjects in the set.
  - $d_m$ is the number of events that occur during the event time.
* $\{n,\ a,\ b\}$ indexes stand to differenciate subjects, $N$ is the total
  number of subjects. $\{\lambda_n = \lambda(t, \textbf{X}_{n})\}$ factors.

# Cox model

The Cox model is a regression model used to predict survival times from a set
of covariates / risk factors.

$$
\begin{align}
\lambda(t, \textbf{X}) = \lambda(t, X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_J) &= \lambda_0(t)\exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{J}\beta_jX_j\right)\\
where:\ \ t\ &is\ the\ time\\
\textbf{X}\ &is\ the\ risk\ factors\ set\\
\lambda_0(t)\ &is\ the\ baseline\ hazard\ function\\\
\lambda(t, \textbf{X})\ &is\ the\ hazard\ function
\end{align}
$$

We can evaluate a _hazard function_ for each subject (mortgage in our case) and
see how it behaves.

## Baseline hazard function

The **baseline hazard function** corresponds to a subject with no risk factors
($\textbf{X} = \textbf{0} \equiv X_j = 0\ \forall\ j$) and is the term that
carries the time dependency of the model. The **baseline hazard function** is
the non-parametric part of the model, and we estimate it after adjusting the
parametric part (which corresponds to $\eta = \pmb{\beta} \cdot \pmb{X}$).

The Cox model is semi-parametric (it doesn't have  $\lambda_0(t)$ predefined),
some particular cases of Cox model have special names (e.g. if $\lambda_0(t) =
pt^{p-1} \ where\ p\ is\ a\ new\ parameter$ is called Weibull, which is a
parametric model). Being semi-parametric allow Cox model to fit multiple cases,
but it is also a limitation, because we can measure just relative risks.

$$
S(t, \pmb{X}) = \exp \left( -\int_0^t \lambda_0(s)\exp\left(\pmb{\beta} \cdot \pmb{X}\right)ds \right) = \exp \left( -\exp\left(\pmb{\beta} \cdot \pmb{X}\right) \int_0^t \lambda_0(s)ds \right) = S(t, \pmb{0})^{\exp\left(\pmb{\beta} \cdot \pmb{X} \right)}
$$

## Main assumptions

* The death times have continuous distributions.
* The probability associated to $X_{j}$ is different from the probability
  associated to $X_{i}$ for any: $1 \leq j \leq J$,  $1\leq i \leq J$ and $j
  \neq i$.
* The covariates vector $\textbf{X}$ is time independent.
* $\beta_j \lt 0$ means increasing $X_j$ is associated with lower risk and thus
  longer survival times. $\beta_j \gt 0$ means the opposite.
* The *hazard ratio* for any 2 subjects:
  
  $$
  \widehat{HR} = \frac{\lambda_a(t, \textbf{X}_a)}{\lambda_b(t, \textbf{X}_b)} = \exp\left( \pmb{\beta} \cdot (\pmb{X}_a - \pmb{X}_b) \right)\\
  if\ X_{ja} = X_{jb}\ \forall\ j\ -\ \{j = i\}\ and\ \pmb{X}_{ia} = \pmb{X}_{ib} - 1\  then:\\
  \widehat{HR} = \exp\left( \beta_i \right)
  $$
  
  This is why the model is called **proportional hazard ratios** and $\beta_j$
  the **log hazard ratio**. If 3 subjects share all the risk factor values but
  one and have identical increments one with respect to each other in that risk
  factor, their hazard functions will be related by a constant, which is the
  hazard ratio and **is time independent**. To probe this assumption is
  fulfilled:
  - Use graphic methods (curves for different groups must be parallel).
  - Check that each covariate effect is time independent.
  - Use [Schoenfeld residuals](#Schoenfeld).

## &beta; <space> estimation

Here I am going to expose how to estimate the $\beta_j$ coefficients by partial
maximum likelihood argument. This method is called "partial" because it doesn't
include censored data but that data affects the number at risk so it is somehow
considered. Let's call:

$$
L = L(\pmb{\beta}) = L(\beta_1,\ \dots,\ \beta_J)
$$

Our **partial likelihood function**. Let's suppose we have $N$ subjects and $M$
death times (so $N - M$  times censored, in our case $N = M$ but this notation
will become handy later). Death times sorted are $t_1,\ \dots,\ t_M$. We can
define our function like:
$$
L = \prod_{m=1}^M L_{t_m} = \prod_{m=1}^M L_m\\
L_{m} = \frac{\lambda(t_m, \pmb{X}_m)}{\sum_{p\ \in\ R(t_m)}\lambda(t_m, X_p)} = \frac{\exp(\pmb{\beta} \ \cdot \pmb{X}_m)}{\sum_{p\ \in\ R(t_m)} \exp(\pmb{\beta}\ \cdot \pmb{X}_p)}
$$

The partial likelihood is a product over the observed failure times of
conditional probabilities, of seeing the observed failure, given the **risk
set** ($R(t_m)$) at that time and that one failure is to happen. In other
words, these are the conditional probabilities of the observed individual being
chosen from the risk set to fail. We can rewrite our likelihood function
equation in a more understandable way:
$$
L_{m} = \frac{\lambda(t_m, \pmb{X}_m)}{\sum_{n=1}^N \delta_n \cdot \lambda(t_m, X_n)} = \frac{\exp(\pmb{\beta} \ \cdot \pmb{X}_m)}{\sum_{n=1}^N \delta_n \cdot \exp(\pmb{\beta}\ \cdot \pmb{X}_n)}\\
$$

And now is we can evaluate **the log likelihood**:
$$
\ell = \log\left(\prod_{m=1}^M L_m\right) = \sum_{m=1}^M \log(L_m) = \sum_{m=1}^M \ell_m\\
\ell_m  = \pmb{\beta} \ \cdot \pmb{X}_m - \log\left(\sum_{n=1}^N \delta_n \cdot \exp(\pmb{\beta}\ \cdot \pmb{X}_n)\right)
$$

Here I have to point that the $\log$ is monotonous on its argument, so it
preserve the same maximums and minimums. We are looking for:
$$
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \beta_j} = 0\ \forall\ j \text{ and }\ \frac{\partial^2 \ell}{\partial\beta_i\partial\beta_j} \leq 0\ \forall\ j,\ i
$$

We can now define the **observed information matrix** and the **variance and
co-variance matrix** as:
$$
I_{ij}(\pmb{\beta}) = -\frac{\partial^2\ell}{\partial\beta_i\partial\beta_j} \Rightarrow\ \hat{\Sigma} = I^{-1}_{ij}(\pmb{\beta})
$$

Which help us to measure the precision with which we can adjust our parameters.

# To be clear
The Cox model is a relative risk model; predictions of type "linear predictor",
"risk", and "terms" are all relative to the sample from which they came. By
default, the reference value for each of these is the mean covariate within
strata. The primary underlying reason is statistical: a Cox model only predicts
relative risks between pairs of subjects within the same strata, and hence the
addition of a constant to any covariate, either overall or only within a
particular stratum, has no effect on the fitted results. Using the
reference="strata" option causes this to be true for predictions as well.
(There have been occasional requests for reference="zero", i.e., a hypothetical
subject with all covariates equal to zero, in order to match certain other
packages' results. The issue is that the results are often silly, e.g., risk
relative to a subject with height, weight, or blood pressure of zero).

# Recurrent events

There are a few ways to adapt the model to recursive events. I have found 5:

1. **The Andersen Gil model (AG)**: It is formulated in terms of increments in
   the number of events along the time line. It uses a **common hazard baseline
   function**($\lambda_0(t)$) for all events and estimates **global
   parameters** ($\beta_j$) for the factors of interest. This is a suitable
   model when correlations among events for each individual can be induced by
   measured covariates. Dependence is captured by appropiate specification of
   time-dependent covariates, such as number of previous events.

2. **Prentice, William and Peterson model (PWT)**: It reccurs to
   stratification, based on the prior number of events during the follow up
   period. In the first stratum all individuals are at risk, in the next one
   only those with an event in the previous and so on. The data will usually be
   limited to specific number of recurrent events, avoiding a too small risk
   set. The time resets after each event.

3. **Marginal means / rates model**: This is the simplest model and consists in
   considering only the mean number of events for each subject. This approach
   does not specify dependence structures among recurrent event times within a
   subject.

    However, since the model does not require time-varying covariates this
    model is more flexible. 

4. **The frailty model**: This model introduces a random covariate that induces
   dependence among recurrent event times. It is common to use random effects
   that follow a gamma distribution with mean equal to one and unknown
   variance.

5. **Multi-state models**: In this model we call change events to transitions,
   which are fully characterized throught estimation of transition
   probabilities between states and transition intensities that are defined as
   instantaneous hazards of progression to one state. This model is common when
   we are facing events of different nature (e.g. hospitalization / death).

# Interpolation
When we are working on survival models we can find several interpolation
methods, that we can generally represent, if $t_0 \leq t \le t_1$, as: $f(s(t))
= f(s(t_0)) + \tfrac{t - t_0}{t_1 - t_0} \cdot \left(f(s(t_1)) -
f(s(t_0))\right)$. Here is a list with some of them:

* Uniform Distribution of Deaths (UDD) / Linear: $f(y) = y$
  
  $$
  s(t) = s(t_0) + \frac{t - t_0}{t_1 - t_0} \cdot \left(s(t_1) - s(t_0)\right)
  $$

* Constant Force (CF): $f(y) = \log(y)$
  
  $$
  \log(s(t)) = \log(s(t_0)) + \frac{t - t_0}{t_1 - t_0} \cdot \left(\log(s(t_1)) - \log(s(t_0)) \right) \rightarrow s(t) = s(t_0)^\tfrac{t_1 - t}{t_1 - t_0} \cdot s(t_1)^\tfrac{t - t_0}{t_1 - t_0}
  $$
  We can see the **force of mortality**:
  
  $$
  -\frac{d}{dt}(\log(s(t))) = -\frac{1}{t_1 - t_0}\log \left(\frac{s(t_0)}{s(t_1)} \right)
  $$
  will be **positive** and constant for every time between $t_0$ and $t_1$.
  
  
* Balducci / Hyperbolic: $f(y) = \tfrac{1}{y}$

  $$
  \frac{1}{s(t)} = \frac{1}{s(t_0)} + \frac{t - t_0}{t_1 - t_0}\left(\frac{1}{s(t_1)} - \frac{1}{s(t_0)}\right) \rightarrow s(t) = \frac{t \cdot \left(s(t_0) - s(t_1)\right) + t_1 \cdot s(t_1) - t_0 \cdot s(t_0)}{(t_1 - t_0) \cdot s(t_1) \cdot s(t_0)}
  $$

## *Comments on* Extrapolation

¿Extrapolation?. There is no such a thing. What you are talking about is,
probably, made up somehow a limit value for your function and try to go from
the latest known point to that limit using the smoothest possible path,
probably with one of the functions defined above. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", class = "center-pic"}
img1_path <- "./extrapolation.png"
include_graphics(img1_path)
```

Extrapolation is always a lie, and you should not lie, but because **_everybody
lies_**, sometimes you will have to use it. So, make it cool, none loves bad
liars. As we live in a mathematically simplified world, it is common that the 
best way to extrapolate is that which preserves the properties that make 
**simple** the extrapolated function (continuity, derivability, being defined 
on the totality or a compact subset of the group to which its domain belongs, 
etc.). Expert criteria, so used to boasting itself in this field, must be 
studied with extreme caution (extreme distrust).

# R-specific notes
When you are using the `Survival::coxph` function to execute a Cox PH model,
your must be careful about how did you express your model formul\ae. First of
all, you must [check
this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/survival.pdf), but I
have found something really useful
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help-es/2015-February/008501.html) that
I don't really want to forget:

1. If you use `target ~ var1 * var2` model will be adjusted with `var1`, `var2`
   and their interaction `var1:var2`. Nothing crazy here.
2. If you use `target ~ var1 * strata(var2)` model will be adjusted with
   `var1`, `var2` and their interaction `var1:var2`; and one hazard baseline
   function will be adjusted for every value of `var2`.
3. If you use `target ~ var1 + strata(var2)` model will be adjusted with `var1`
   and one hazard baseline function will be adjusted for every value of `var2`.
4. If you use `target ~ var1 * strata(var2) + strata(var3)` model will be
   adjusted with `var1`, `var2` and their interaction `var1:var2`; and one
   hazard baseline function will be adjusted for every possible pair of values
   of (`var2`, `var3`).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
message("It seems pretty easy to understand but it is not easy to find and
because the models will have slightly differences on their coefficients from not
equal but equivalent ones, this could make you lose hours as it made to me.")
```
