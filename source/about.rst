Why another blog?
=================

After over-thinking the idea of doing a blog for too much time I decided to
make a step and start writing this. At the beginning this was just an excuse to
learn `blogdown <https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown>`_ and collect some
how-to-use guides of programs that I was using every now and then. Probably
that's what this still is. But I hope that it becomes a powerful tool for
people learning technology related things and coming from a science field, as I
do.

I have forced myself to make a post of everything interesting that I have been
working on, what I have found as a lovely routine of learning and accommodating
that knowledge. When I am talking about something that I have learnt, I try to
make it in a decently structured way, even if I am not doing it in my mother
tongue. So every post has its own pleasure - effort equilibrium which is,
probably, the best way to understand it.
