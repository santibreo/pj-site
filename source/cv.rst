Curriculum Vitae
================

I am a Math enthusiast whose heart was stolen by Linux. At first Maple and Matlab, but then R, Python, Scala and Go came to shape my ideas. Fan of trying and failing and breaking things, I've worked mostly in data analysis roles, but I've also been developing for a hacking team or validating risk assessment models since I have been in this sector for more than 5 years now. I am a puzzle lover and really need challenging work to feel in shape.
