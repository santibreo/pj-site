Curriculum Vitae
================

Probably the turning point that drives me here was when, during the last year
of my Physics degree, an exercise on the Ising Model put me in contact with
Linux, programming and modelling complex systems. Soon after I was into the
world of data science, always trying to increase my practical knowledge without
neglecting the theoretical part.
