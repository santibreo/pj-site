Curriculum Vitae
================

During the last year of my Physics degree, an exercise on the Ising Model put me in contact with Linux, programming and modelling complex systems. Soon after I was into the world of data science building forest and networks and understanding how the machines learn. Since then I have become a Linux enthusiast (Arch ⊕ Vim for the win), always trying to increase my practical knowledge without neglecting the theoretical part.
