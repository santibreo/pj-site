Curriculum Vitae
================

I would define myself as a mathematics enthusiast whose heart was stolen by Linux. Since I started modelling complex systems with specialized languages like Maple and Matlab, I understood the universe of possibilities that was opening before me. Soon, I was trying more general-purpose languages like R or Python, and today, I can't resist using the latest language out of the basement of any American college. A fan of trying and failing and breaking and fixing things, I started working primarily as a data scientist, shifting with years to mentoring and team management. I'm a puzzle-lover looking for stimulating work to keep me feeling in shape.
