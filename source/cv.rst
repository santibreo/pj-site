Curriculum Vitae
================

I am a Math enthusiast whose heart was stolen by Linux. At first, I used Maple and Matlab, but then R and Python came to shape my ideas (and I am still descending that abstraction ladder). Fan of trying and failing and breaking things, I've worked mainly as a data scientist, sometimes more entangled with code tasks (I have worked as a developer for a hacking team), others with the mathematical part (I have also worked as a financial risk model validator). I am a puzzle lover and really need challenging work to feel in shape.
