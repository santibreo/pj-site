Web places that I love
======================

A lot of the work that I exhibit here comes from Youtube channels, or websites,
or another blogs that are doing an excellent work.  One of the reasons why I
have started this blog is to put all their work together. Here I have decided
to play a collector role more than a creator one.  Of course the posts tagged
as _project_ are personal, even if I have started getting inspiration from one
of these.

Lets stop talking about me, and start talking about the ones that deserve:

* `Luke Smith <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA>`_:
	*I feel like he is my soulmate.*

* `Corey Shaffer <https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5>`_:
	*Probably the most robust way of learning python that I have found.*

* `EngineerMan <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrUL8K81R4VBzm-KOYwrcxQ>`_:
	*Cool guy that can make anything understandable.*

* `Sentdex <https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex>`_:
	*Best place to start with almost anything data-science related.*

* `Raymond Hettinger <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANN2Eu6ZnM>`_ (just a video):
	*Hard to define how much I love this guy.*

* `James Powell <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4&t=2823s>`_ (just a video):
	*Python God, he represents everything that I would love to become.*

* `3Blue1Brown <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw>`_:
    *Best online place to learn math fundamentals, and probably the sexiest voice you gonna hear.*

* `Yihui Xie <https://github.com/yihui>`_:
    *I think she is the R's mother.*
