<h1>Apache Hadoop &amp; Spark<a class="headerlink" href="#apache-hadoop-spark" title="Permalink to this headline"> &sect;</a></h1>
<p>This may sound like a too old topic to make a post in 2020, but it is the first
knowledge that I want to consolidate.</p>
<p>I could start this post like many others, talking about how much the world has
changed in the last 20 years (since 2003), showing some cool diagrams about the
data that nowadays is generated in a minute in the Internet and explaining how
now _everything_, literally _everything_, is collecting data. I somehow hate
this kind of talks because I think that they create the biggest possible hype
and what comes after that is always someone selling a product. Of course
there’s a lot of people living from selling technical solutions, but let’s try
to make our analysis a bit more realistic.</p>
<p>2 sentences to define the current scenario:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>Global Data Sphere</strong> quantifies and analyses the amount of data
created, captured, and replicated in any given year across the world. We are
expecting it to hit 175 ZB (Zettabytes) by 2025.</p></li>
<li><p>Nowadays, most of this data is generated by people, so it is unstructured.
But machines data, which is structured, is growing fast and we must expect
that it will take over soon (by 2030).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This humongous amount of data requires new solutions to deal with it: how to
store it and how to analyse it. Thankfully, in 2003 <a class="reference external" href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf)">Google brought up a
solution</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="big-data">
<h2>Big Data<a class="headerlink" href="#big-data" title="Permalink to this headline"> &sect;</a></h2>
<p>If you have read something about Big Data before you had probably heard about
the 3 Vs (Volume, Variety, Velocity) that have became around 10. I don’t like
this definition for Big Data because it makes it hard to identify what is a Big
Data problem.</p>
<p>I think that a better approach is to define Big Data as a set of technologies
and architectures for storing, moving, accessing and processing data, and so, a
Big Data problem is one whose best solution involves these technologies.</p>
<p>Once that has been said, let’s get a little deep into the technology.</p>
<div class="section" id="distributed-computation">
<h3>Distributed Computation<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed-computation" title="Permalink to this headline"> &sect;</a></h3>
<p>Assumed that one server is not enough to store the data the solution seems
obvious: we need more than one. So let’s start using <strong>clusters</strong>. If we make
our servers (nodes in the future) cooperate quickly enough, we can increase our
computing power by adding new nodes, in such a way that each node doesn’t need
to be too powerful. To know what I am referring to when I talk about servers
and nodes, we need to open a brief parenthesis here:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualisation">
<h3>Virtualisation<a class="headerlink" href="#virtualisation" title="Permalink to this headline"> &sect;</a></h3>
<p>Before 2001 (first VMWare release) it was pretty common that one server was
used to host just one application (and one Operating System). This imposes a
fast growth of the datacenters, were almost all the CPU’s were around 90% of
the time idle. Virtualisation rises as a technology to optimize how we were
using hardware. It allow multiple <em>computers</em> to be host by the same server,
sharing resources. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a>
has been predicting how our computational power grow for the last 50 years, so
servers have been duplicating its computational power every 18 months and now
they can host hundreds of virtual machines. This implies that most of the
_machines_ that we are using are virtual and are not associated to a physical
server and that opened the doors for <strong>cloud computing</strong> (companies sharing
computing infrastrucure). But because it is not far enough in time when one
server hosted just one computer, now word ‘server’ is used to refer to one of
the rack slots, and to one virtual machine. This should not cause any confusion
as far as we have cleared this concepts.</p>

<div class="section" id="hadoop">
<h2>Hadoop<a class="headerlink" href="#hadoop" title="Permalink to this headline"> &sect;</a></h2>
<p>Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for storing and processing Big
Data in a distributed manner on large clusters of commodity hardware. It is
licensed under the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache v2
license</a> and written in Java. It
is based on Google’s GFS paper (published in 2003) so it has been develop in
parallel (sometimes interwined) with virtualisation, and both have had a fast
evolution.</p>
<p>Hadoop allow us to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Store huge amount of data</strong>: It will be distributed in what is called a DataNode, that has blocks inside which size you can select. So the data  will be divided in blocks of the selected size and then that’s blocks will go to usually many DataNodes, so the data is replicated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Store a variety of data</strong>: Haddop (and its file system) do not have a pre-dumping schema validation so you can store structured, semi-structured or unstructured data with no complain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process data faster</strong>: Data will be processed on its own DataNode (processing is moved to the data) so it won’t travel anywhere before being processed, so every data block is processed in parallel (at the same time), and then the result is composed and sent as response.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="map-reduce">
<h3>Map Reduce<a class="headerlink" href="#map-reduce" title="Permalink to this headline"> &sect;</a></h3>
<p>This is the oldest paradigm to compute distributed data, so it is the first one that appeared around, now it’s practically not used but most of the new techniques to compute distributed data are based on it.</p>
